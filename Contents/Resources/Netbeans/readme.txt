Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX
I have created a #MacOS package to run #NetBeans natively. The package is available on #GitHub from this link: https://github.com/Webbiefourth/Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX â€¦

Download Apache NetBeans 9.x from https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html

Once you have the downloaded package, expand it in directory "netbeans\ 9.0.app/Contents/Resources/Netbeans/".

Now you have a runnable MacOS X NetBeans.

Enjoy!
