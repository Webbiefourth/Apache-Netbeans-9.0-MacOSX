# Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX

If you want a ready-made MacOS Netbeans package, you've found it. Continue reading this simple read me page. If you want to create your own Netbeans package, on MacOS using simple Bash script, go to https://github.com/Webbiefourth/ASF-Netbeans-MacOSX-packager/blob/master/README.md.

For a prepackaged version 9.0 Netbeans, I have created a #MacOS package to run #NetBeans natively. The package is available on #GitHub from this link:
https://github.com/Webbiefourth/Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX â€¦

Download Apache NetBeans 9.x from https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html

Once you have the downloaded, or cloned, package Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX, expand it in directory "Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX-master".

On your system you will end up with a directory, something like "Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX-master". The directory should include a shell app named "Netbeans 9.0.app" together with this README.md file and Apache v2 License. Download and expand latest netbeans binary package in "Netbeans 9.0.app/Contents/Resources/Netbeans" and your shell app is ready to run as Netbeans. If your newly downloaded binary is higher version than 9.0, then you will have to update info.plist and the app name to reflect the version change. You can always just use the https://github.com/Webbiefourth/ASF-Netbeans-MacOSX-packager/blob/master/README.md packager Bash shell-script, which will create you a new application in the time it takes to download the new Apache Netbeans binary.

Now you have a runnable MacOS X NetBeans.

Enjoy!
