# Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX

If you want a ready-made MacOS Netbeans package, you've found it. Continue reading this simple read me page. If you want to create your own Netbeans package, on MacOS using simple Bash script, go to https://github.com/Webbiefourth/ASF-Netbeans-MacOSX-packager/blob/master/README.md.

For a prepackaged version 9.0 Netbeans, I have created a #MacOS package to run #NetBeans natively. The package is available on #GitHub from this link:
https://github.com/Webbiefourth/Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX â€¦

Download Apache NetBeans 9.x from https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html

Once you have the downloaded, or cloned, package Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX, expand it in directory "Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX-master/Contents/Resources/Netbeans".

On your system you will end up with a directory, something like "Apache-Netbeans-9.0-MacOSX-master". Once you have downloaded and expanded the netbeans version, as mentioned above, rename this root directory to "netbeans 9.0.app". 

Now you have a runnable MacOS X NetBeans.

Enjoy!
